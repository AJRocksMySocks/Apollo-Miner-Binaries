## Starting your hashboard

After you have downloaded the release binaries for your system, you will find start scripts inside the folder. You need to edit the "start_apollo" files with your pool/settings (instructions inside).

For windows simply double click the .bat file to start, and on linux open a terminal, cd into the binary folder and run with

```sh
$ sudo ./start_apollo.sh
```
